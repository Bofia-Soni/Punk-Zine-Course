Notes Hjördis

- the coloors are on a good way, the notes are a fun way to tell a story
- - the title in the head is different to the title on the site
i think it can help to get more of the punkzine feeling to make it more monochromatic (black and white, or one color and white like in riso
the x before the title give the feeling like you can only close it at that area
-the titles on the notes need sometimes moore spacing
-maybe do the notes in black and white an changing sothat there certains aspects of your website that says the same


- is there unneccesary js that we can delete 
- items are not cliclable anymore once other item is clicked 
- also faces just one appears
- stable move (rotate, scale) logic




COLOR ARRAY LOGIC ADDED IN COLORCHANGE.HTML
How it works (quick explanation)
Math.random() * colors.length
→ gives a random number between 0 and array length

Math.floor(...)
→ turns it into a valid array index

colors[randomIndex]
→ selects a random color


creating a list (array)
const colors = ['yellow', 'red', 'blue', 'green', 'purple'];
An array is a list of values.
they all get indexed
0	yellow
1	red
2	blue
3	green
4	purple
Important:Arrays start counting at 0, not 1
Why const? const means:“This variable will not be replaced with something else.”

Math.random() — getting randomness 🎲
Math.random()


This gives a random number between 0 and 1, for example:

0.13

0.67

0.999

⚠️ It will never be exactly 1.
