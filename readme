COLOR ARRAY LOGIC ADDED IN COLORCHANGE.HTML
How it works (quick explanation)
Math.random() * colors.length
→ gives a random number between 0 and array length

Math.floor(...)
→ turns it into a valid array index

colors[randomIndex]
→ selects a random color


creating a list (array)
const colors = ['yellow', 'red', 'blue', 'green', 'purple'];
An array is a list of values.
they all get indexed
0	yellow
1	red
2	blue
3	green
4	purple
Important:Arrays start counting at 0, not 1
Why const? const means:“This variable will not be replaced with something else.”

Math.random() — getting randomness 🎲
Math.random()


This gives a random number between 0 and 1, for example:

0.13

0.67

0.999

⚠️ It will never be exactly 1.
